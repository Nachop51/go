Hello, World, in the code we weave,
In the syntax and logic, we believe.
From the first line to the last,
We build our future, learn from the past.

Hello, World, in the loops we spin,
Finding bugs, oh where to begin?
In functions and variables, truth we find,
In every algorithm, a creative mind.

Hello, World, in the code we trust,
To create, to build, is a must.
In every line of code, a new story unfurls,
This is our tribute, to you, Hello, World!
